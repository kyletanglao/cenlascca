                Hunter Knight has an extensive background in drag racing, most notably his successes in bracket racing with his 1967 Chevrolet Camaro. His other racing experience includes several seasons of online sim racing, first in iRacing and now in Gran Turismo Sport. <br></br><br></br>Hunter’s autocross journey has put him behind the wheel of several cars including the Toyota Corolla, Ford Fiesta ST, Scion FRS, a couple of Mazda Miatas, and of course his own Pontiac Grand Prix GTP.  This event was Hunter’s personal best overall pax finish, sitting pretty in the #6 slot with Carl Meaux’s ‘94 Mazda Miata R-Package.

                <b>K. Tanglao:</b> Hunter, congratulations on your second top 10 pax placement. You put Carl’s NA Miata on the #8 pax spot at last year’s SOWELA ULL event and now you have grabbed #6 here at Lamar-Dixon. Since these are your top two finishes in the same car, is it safe to say that you have found a car that takes advantage of your driving style? 
                </div><br></br>
                <div class="left">
                <b>H. Knight: </b>I feel like that would be a safe assumption. Carl’s NA is a great car to drive, and the entire time I’m in the seat I have a smile from ear to ear. I was naturally drawn to the street touring class in my own pursuits, due to the aggressive stance and wide track that can be obtained, but the way I meshed with the way an ES car handles is amazing. I feel like ES is the class that I will best perform.

                <b>K. Tanglao: </b>Yeah, it is a great car; I always felt like it had a light and balanced feel to it whenever I was driving it. Very predictable and allows you to drive without any distractions. It is the car that got me into Miatas in the first place, so I could go on forever talking about it.
                <br></br><br></br>
                But let’s talk about race day. I’ve heard that you had quite the journey leading up to the competition. Can you describe some of the feelings that you had on the grid? Maybe talk to us about your strategy before run 1?

                <div class="left">
                <b>H. Knight: </b> Well, it was an eventful weekend to say the least. I had to retrieve the car from where it was staying in Lafayette (100 miles), so that was a really fun drive to the event along I-10. You know, being between two semi-trucks in a top-down Miata isn’t too fun. 
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                When arriving on grid, I was met with an odd calmness that is unusual for me when leading up to an event. It was a really cold morning, and I guess being focused on staying warm took away the nerves I would have usually been feeling at the time. 
In the course walk, I noticed that this was going to be a ‘brainer’ course. There were many sections in the course that would really punish those that took the incorrect line, such as the transition. In the transition, you had to really commit to the inputs you were making in order to hold a fast and proper line, extracting as much time as possible out of that section.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                From what I observed, many of the drivers at the event were losing the majority of their time there. After my course walks, I decided to take some time to sit in the car and go back over what I did at the SOWELA event where I drove the Miata last. Getting back accustomed to a car that I had not driven aggressively for 6 months was a big fear going into my first run. Was I going to spin the car? Was I going to stall it at the start? Or was I going to lock up into a braking zone? All of these thoughts began to race through my mind when I finally put my helmet on for my first run. I have a saying that I like to stick to, and it helps me get through those first runs of the day that may seem overwhelming: “A clean run to start the day.”
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I repeat that phrase in my head before each of my first runs, and it helps to clear my mind of all the mistakes I could make, and helps me focus on getting through the course and making sure I know which direction to go. It does you no good to start the day with a DNF, and no matter if you believe it or not, a DNF on your first run will change your mindset for the rest of the day.

                <b>K. Tanglao: </b> How did it feel after you landed that 44.060? With that kind of time, it was clear that you made it into the top 10 pax.

                <b>H. Knight: </b> It was a surreal feeling. I kind of had a feeling after my first run that I had a solid hold on the course, and to see that time pop up on my 4th, was met with instant nerves. “Was it clean, please tell me it was clean” was all I could say inside my head as I kept refreshing live timing waiting for the result to appear. When it finally appeared, I knew that that event was going to be a good result for me. The rest of the day, I was trying for a 43.x, because I knew the car had at least a 43.4xx in it with myself driving that day, but couldn't quite pull it off. Coming off of a slight slump in recent events, it was really refreshing to see myself pulling some good times for some good results. The last few events really put me through the wringer and made me start to doubt myself a bit, but this event made me realize that I can't just give up on progress. If I want to keep the results I have obtained, I have to put in the work, get the seat time, and make the right changes to propel me up the results chart. Owning a car I can autocross consistently might help with that situation.

                <b>K. Tanglao: </b>What did you think of the course in general? Was there a certain element or section where you knew there was enough time left in it to find a 43.4xx?
                </div>    
                <br></br>  
                <div class="left">
                <b>H. Knight: </b>The course was phenomenal in my opinion. Khai does a really good job of designing really technical courses that make you think about multiple elements in advance. I really enjoyed how much the course rewarded commitment and not being afraid to take out a couple cones on your way to finding the perfect line. There were a couple elements that I could have slightly improved, but in general, my weakness was in the far ‘sweeper’ and in the leftward 180 after the start. On both of those elements, I was just going really slow. Exiting the 180, I was always late on the throttle, while also pushing out too wide on the exit and disrupting my line into the offsets. Through the sweeper, I was not carrying the steady arc that some of the faster guys were doing and having to make more input to get through the 6 pack after. In the 6 pack, I was pinching off my line too much and losing momentum on the run to the transition. Just improving those elements, I could have dropped my overall time at least a half of a second, while I could gain the rest of my time by taking the final left turn to the finish a little better. I still don't know what was the perfect line through that corner, but I noticed a lot of our top finishers taking it tighter than I was. When I say it like that, you would think my 44.060 wasn't that great after all; but being that it got me into 6th position in PAX, it didn’t demotivate me one bit, because I knew that better finishes were within reach.

                <b>H. Knight: </b>You should never doubt your abilities as a driver. Never look at what you’ve done and think its the best you can do. At the last few events, I felt that I had hit a plateau, my performance couldn't get any better, and that my placement was where I was going to end up at every event. Just having that mindset will set you back further than you could ever think; it will seriously mess with your head. Going into this event, I completely stripped my mind of all of those thoughts of mediocrity, and put my best effort into my driving at the event. By the first run, I had already figured out how much of a difference that mindset really made. Don’t shoot for mediocrity, only settle for the best.
